There is a board with letter tiles, and the player forms words to score points, and unlock new levels. Depending on the level type, there is either a move limit, a time limit, or a specific set of words to find. We also created a separate application to design and export levels to be played in the main game. We used Java to code LetterCraze, specifically Swing for the interface, and JUnit for unit testing.
