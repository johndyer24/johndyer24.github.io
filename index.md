<p class="bio">
  <span class="emphasis">Welcome!</span> I am a student and developer at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, interested in software engineering, web development, and data science. I have experience with React Native mobile app development, frontend web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and backend development using Node.js and frameworks such as express and socket.io. My strengths include a solid understanding of object-oriented design principles, the ability to collaborate effectively with others, and a strong drive to learn new skills and concepts. I created this website to share examples of my work.
