  <p class="detail-card-description">
    Dropwise is a startup at WPI that creates products that do social good. I joined last November to help develop Driply, a mobile platform for charity. To be able to contribute, I have been teaching myself React Native and other mobile development concepts. Over the summer, I helped build a prototype version, which I describe in more detail <a href="/projects/driply/">here</a>.

  <p class="detail-card-description">
     I also helped pitch Driply at several events. The last was a competition for <a href="https://www.wcti.org/press/startup-worcester-2017" target="_blank">StartUp Worcester</a>, an initiative of the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce’s Higher Education – Business Partnership, The Venture Forum, and Worcester CleanTech Incubator to provide support and work space to the region's entrepreneurs. Our pitch was recieved well and we were accepted into the program. We are currently developing a beta version of the app.
