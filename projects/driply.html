					<p class="detail-card-description">Driply is a social, competetive mobile game that allows players to contribute to charitable causes and champion change. The general idea is that users can play trivia to earn "drops," which represent money that can then be donated to causes of their choice. Buisinesses will be able to sign up with us to advertise through sponsored trivia questions, align their brand with charity, and obtain data regarding what users know about them and what causes they care about.</p>

					<p class="detail-card-description">The first thing I did was learn React Native, in order to develop for ios and android simultaneously. I worked through several online tutorials and classes, examined open source examples, and experimented on my own. By the end of last school year, I had a strong enough understanding of React Native to start coding Driply</p>
					<p class="detail-card-description">Over the summer, I collaborated with two other students to develop a prototype. I helped create a simple functioning front-end, using Redux to manage application state. I connected the front-end to Firebase in order to store data, and I learned how to use Facebook's API for user authentication. Currently, we are refining our ideas of what we want Driply to be, and using our experiences from the summer to develop a more finished version.</p>
