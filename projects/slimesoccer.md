  <p class="detail-card-description">I worked with two other students to create a multiplayer web game, <a href="http://slimesoccer.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Slime Soccer</a>. We used technologies such as Node.js, Express, and Socket.io in order to allow multiple users to be able to play together in real time.</p>

  <p class="detail-card-description">Users are able to join an existing game room, or create their own with custom physics. We also implemented simple but rather effective AI players for single-player gameplay.</p>
