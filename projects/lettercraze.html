					<p class="detail-card-description">LetterCraze was the main deliverable for my Software Engineering class. I was in a team of five students, and we had seven weeks to plan and build this game, based on the rules provided to us. LetterCraze is similar to boggle. There is a board with letter tiles, and the player forms words to score points, and unlock new levels. Depending on the level type, there is either a move limit, a time limit, or a specific set of words to find. We also created a separate application to design and export levels to be played in the main game.</p>

					<h4 class="detail-card-caption">A typical level</h4>
					<p class="detail-card-description">My team started out by developing a set of use cases that captured all the possible interactions between the player and the application. We then created UML class diagrams, and used the Model-View-Controller design pattern when deciding how to organize our classes.</p>

					<h4 class="detail-card-caption">Map of game levels</h4>
					<p class="detail-card-description">I mostly worked on the controller and model classes. I implemented gameplay features such as calculating points and progress after each move, repopulating the board after each move, and undoing moves. I also took initiative to solve any bugs I encountered, so I ended up touching most areas of our code. In doing so, I gained a strong understanding of how everything worked together, and how I could structure any future applications I might create.</p>
					<p class="detail-card-description">My team used Java to code LetterCraze, specifically Swing for the interface, and JUnit for unit testing. The source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/TeamCopperSoftware/LetterCraze/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
